Significant Description of Local Findings App:

The code uses React Navigation to set up the navigation stack, with each screen component imported and registered with the navigator.

Now, let's ensure each screen receives the necessary data. Using route.params in the screen components (Attractions, Business, Hospitals, Restaurants), data is passed after the navigation setup. Then the data which is in the given database is uploaded. 

With this setup, when the app starts, it will display the Home screen. From there, users can navigate to other screens like Attractions, Businesses, Hospitals, and Restaurants using buttons or gestures, and each screen will display the relevant information based on the selected city or search query.

When the user chooses a specific option from the displayed options, then it will redirect to the Google Maps page where the user can find the details of distance, directions, and other options. 

This Local Findings App will ensure the user a feasibility in navigating the screens, data passings, and UI rendering work.
